This mod is for playing, to shared or to create maps.
But All the textures and soundtracks, may not be copied** or be edited!

Most Textures and soundtrack were self-made or are heavily edited Forts Vanilla/DLC textures, only the standard Forts props/grounds do not fall under CC.

If you want to create a mod using some Textures etc. you can still ask me, depending on the situation I might allow or deny the request.

**This excludes the automatic download by steam.
